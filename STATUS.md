## WaitList App

Team: Waitlist App

Team Number: 13

Members: Avie Desai, Naveli Shah, Ben Chesney, Surya Manikonda

## Introduction:

Highlights:

So far, we have managed to create and successfully build a prototype of the application. We have created a home page to display different restaurants and their waiting times so that the user can check-in. Since our app is based on user check-in and check-out we have created a page to let the user tell us whether they received their food yet (checking out). We also have a feedback page to rate the app and submit any comments.

Overview:

We have not made any changes and followed the design and other requirements mentioned in the proposal.


## Customer Value:

No changes were made from the original project proposal.


## Technology:

Architecture:

We have been using Xcode for creating and testing the app. The main portion of our app, the User Interface uses Xcode's various options and components such as the View Controller, buttons, and tables. To get the most accurate waiting times we are using location tracking and storing the waiting times in Google Firebase. 

Goals for this iteration:

Our goal for this iteration was to simply build a basic working prototype. The goals were to create a home page to display different restaurants and their waiting times, a check-out page and a feedback page. The screenshots below show the home page, check-out page, and the feedback page.

Tests ran:

We have been mainly using the iPhone simulator in Xcode to test the app. Using the iPhone simulator for testing allowed us to see what features were working and what changes or modifications we need to make app work. Testing the app on the simulator also allowed us to see what our app would like in a real-world environment. 

Future iteration goals:

Going forward, we want to extensively test our app to see if the core functionality works. We also want to see if we are successfully storing the waiting times on to Google Firebase. After letting others use the app and receiving feedback, we will make necessary changes to improve the app in general. 


## Team:

Team member roles:

Since Avie has previous experience working on iOS applications, we decided that he is the team leader. Avie has been assigning issues to everyone and helping all the team members. We all have been working on our assigned issues and contributing to the app. Going forward, the team member roles will be the same. 


## Project Management:

Schedule:

The project is on schedule. As mentioned in our project proposal we have completed the goal to get the basic functionality of the application working. Now, we are testing the app, removing the features which are not working and adding necessary changes.


## Reflection:

Many things went well, such as the team structure, all team members contributing to the project, and completing and reaching the deadlines. With the team structure being successful, we havenâ€™t been creating issues in GitHub but communicating within the team to assign which team member gets which task to complete. As we continue working on the project, we will specifically use the issues feature on GitHub to easily view and track the changes we make to the project.
